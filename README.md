# Welcome to the ODM2 Organization
This is a meta-repository to help navigate the many repositories under the ODM2 GitHub Organization.

The ODM2 development team is a group of researchers working across geoscience disciplines to develop and implement an information model and supporting software tools for collecting, storing, managing, and sharing feature-based Earth Observations in a way that extends interoperability, improves data sharing, and supports scientific research.

# Support and Credits
ODM2 and related software have been developed under funding from several different sources. This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grants [EAR-1224638](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1224638), [ACI-1339834](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339834)). Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. 

ODM2 draws heavily form our prior work with the CUAHSI Hydrologic information system and ODM 1.1.1 (Horsburgh et al., 2008; Horsburgh and Tarboton, 2008), our experiences workin on the Critical Zone Observatory Integrated Data Management System (CZOData), and our experiences with the EarthChem systems (e.g., Lehnert et al., 2007; Lehnert et al., 2009). It also extensively uses concepts from the Open Geospatial Consortium's Observations & Measurements standard (Cox, 2007a; Cox, 2007b; Cox, 2011a; Cox, 2011b; ISO, 2011).
